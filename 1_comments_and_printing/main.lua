-- ok, so you can print with double quotes
print("hello, world!")

--[[ or
you
can
use
single
quotes ]]

print('hello, world!')

-- you can also print many things at once

print("2", "times", "in", "a", "row") -- however, it adds a tab between each of the arguments

-- so we can use:

print("2" .. "times" .. "in" .. "a" .. "row") -- so it will print all of them together
