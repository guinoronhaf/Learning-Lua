# Learning Lua

Lua is a procedural programming language, used to develop softwares, work with machine learning and all types of games. It's also "easy" to learn and it has a fast _exec speed_.

## Comments

In lua, comments have the following structure:

```lua
-- here is a comment
```

In case you want to comment a block of text, try:

```lua
--[[
    here is a comment in block
]]
```

## Printing to the screen

Here, you can use double or single quotes:

```lua
print("hello, world!")
```
